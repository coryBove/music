### Where did my marlbles go?

Sunday, June 14th - I wrote and recorded my first song during the early morning. It took about 2 hours start to finish. I've been playing guitar since I was 15, and I'm currently 30. The guitar part was not hard for me personally, just normal everyday noodling. This was, however, the first time I tried to write down lyrics. I shared this directly with friends/family via the link above with mixed results. Regardless, my confidence sky-rocketed.

Later (sometime between Sunday and Wednesday) - I set up shop in my garage with my amp and a Ditto looper pedal. I noodled around with a loop and 'solo' for about 10 minutes, playing the Am pentatonic scale (my personal favorite). My neighbors 2 doors down applauded my performance with a standing ovation and asked for an encore. WOW! My confidence grew even more!

Wednesday Night (June 17) - I met with a local guitar legend for a lesson we'd been planning. It goes well! After our lesson, I sent him a very strongly worded message about how I wanted to get my start in music. My plan is - tour local bars, and hopefully build enough notariety to play a show at my old High School. My High School will be torn down and replaced soon - The levy passed, we have the money, it is time. It will, however, be missed.

Thursday (June 18th) - I quit my job as a software developer. A well paid, comfortable position where I could work from home with a lot of flexibility. I decided if I keep working software, I won't have enough time to practice like I need to. Between savings, and a portion of the money my father left me when he passed, I have enough saved up for 3-6 months living expenses. Many of us here know that developer positions are in high demand, and if my music/message doesn't go anywhere, I will be looking for a job.

Also Thursday - I reach out to a local martial arts instructor (not TKD). In college, I studied Tae Kwon Do in a student club. I have very fond memories of learning and bonding with my teammates, and I keep in touch with some of them to this day. I can't wait to get started doing martial arts again! My goal with this is to build confidence in myself, exercise in a fun way, and (hopefully not!) be ready for drunk/unruly fans while I'm 'touring' the area.
(This is not a challenge, please keep things peaceful. I do not and will not support violence in any way. Martial Arts is an ART. It is one of the few domains left to us humans, like art and music.)

Late Thursday Night - Over the last few nights, I had a lot of trouble getting sufficient sleep. If you're a mental health expert, you probably have some insight into why this was happening. Personally, I think all of the excitement did me in. I started feeling really 'trippy' after everyone else went to bed. I woke up my roommate, who then called my mother. At my request, we called an ambulance, and I was sent to the ER for a pysch evaluation eary Friday (19th) morning, and diagnosed with 'Acute Mania/Psychosis'.

When people think 'Manic', they might think 'Manic depressive'. I was the opposite of what you would consider depressed. I was completely on top of the world and feeling great. TOO great. This feeling built up slowly over time until I realized it was too late.

Sunday, 6/21/2020 I was released to my mother, and returned to my own home.

From the police who arrived on scene first, to the EMS crew who arrived second, to the ER docs/nurses who recieved me, and the 'Unit for Oberservation' folks who took care of me after the ER visit, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!

You were all absolutely wonderful, and I am eternally grateful for your help.
