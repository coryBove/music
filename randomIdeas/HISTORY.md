Hello!

If you're wondering who I am, you've come to the right place.

I'm The Luckiest person in the world. (Not to be confused with Ben Folds, whom I've seen live twice and IS AWESOME!)

Pleasure to meet you!

I was born and raised in the most beautiful city in the world - Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.
I attended the public school system here, and was a slightly-above-average lazy student.

In 2008, I graduated High School, went to Cleveland State University, and subsequently had a mental breakdown a few months into the first semester.

In 2010, I began attending Ohio University, with the original intention of studying music therapy. I didn't get far. I switched to Plant Biology, made some awesome friends in the Tae Kwon Do club, regularly went to Jackie O's brewery for freshly brewed beers/lunch, and subsequently had a mental breakdown in March of 2011.

It was in March 2011 that I was diagnosed with Chronic Undifferentiated Schizophrenia. That diagnosis was later changed to Paranoid Schizophrenia. Mental health disorders are notoriously hard to categorize, so the proper label for my issue is unimportant. Just know - I have a mental illness.

In 2012, with the help of Gov't aid, a professionally administered aptitude test, and a lot of love and support from my family, I began attending The University of Akron where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I stayed on a while for a Master's degree, but I never finished. I went to work in the software industry as an entry-level developer in 2016.

I've learned a ton on the job, not only about software, but about businesses and people. I met some really great people over the years, and I still keep in touch with some of them. Cheers, you know who you are!

I've had 3 professional gigs from 2016 to 2020, where I left my job June 18th to pursue more music, writing, and art.

In High School, 2006 - 2007, I spent almost a full year in Argentina as a foreign exchange student. This was the experience of a lifetime, and I have so many great memories from that time. I do still keep in touch with a lot of my friends/family, and they're all doing well!

I've been playing guitar since I was 15, when my Dad got my first guitar for Christmas from Woodsy's in Kent.

My Dad passed away March 29th, 2017. I love and miss him dearly, but without this happening I would not be the person I am today. He left my sister and I his retirement savings from working 5, 10 hour days, and 8 on most Saturdays as a Brake Press Operator his whole life. He was the hardest worker I have ever known, and I want to emulate that behavior as best I can.

When my Dad passed, my reflections on life really began. What does it all mean? What am I doing with myself? How should I spend my free time? After much deliberation on these topics, I decided I might as well stick with music as my 'full time hobby' outside of work. I had always played guitar, but I never pursued it seriously until I conciously made this decision.

Since then, I've been hard at work practicing, taking lessons from some great teachers, playing as much as I can get my hands on it, etc. I absolutely love it. A comment on a YouTube jam track read 'This is meditation.' It truly is! I want to share my love of music with the world, and share with people how it has helped me through tough times.

My father's retirement savings is my last-ditch safety net. From working a job that pays typically higher than most others, and living somewhat frugally, I've been able to add a cushion to that safety net, and I'm ready to try this out.
