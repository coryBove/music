If I told you that I was quitting my job, and you had no clue who I was, would you worry about me?

If someone told you that you may be losing your job, would you be afraid? Why?
What is the first thing that comes to mind?

Many people cannot live day to day without a steady paycheck and health insurance, and I truly believe this anxiety is holding society back. If you are working on this problem, please keep fighting the good fight.

Please, do not read this and just up and leave your job. Jobs are good. Money is good. They make the world go 'round. We need hard workers. We need people to make sacrifices that others are not willing or prepared to make. Keep up the hard work!

I consider myself at this moment very, VERY fortunate to be out of work, but this will not last long without support.

If you have a passion project you've been considering, spread your wings. Just BE CAUTIOUS. Also, make sure you're not in it for the money. If you're wondering how you'd make ends meet, you're likely not ready.
