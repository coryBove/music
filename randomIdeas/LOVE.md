I am completely committed to loving you.

When I told you, I never felt anything like it.
They always say that when you know it's the right person, you will not have a doubt.

I have no doubt.

It was such a weight to bare, that I don't care if you return the favor. It will hurt. I will move on.
You knowing is better than holding it in any longer.

I'm an all or nothing kind of guy.

There's so many pretty women out there, but since telling you, I only see them as more beautiful. I believe this is because I now see them as they are, and not as potential mates.

Thank you for this deep insight into my soul.
