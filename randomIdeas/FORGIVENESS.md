This is a Billy Madison-esque list begging forgiveness from some of the people I have wronged.

Kinder, 1st grade?? During a soccer game - I pushed you during gym class. I was disciplined. I still think about it. I'm sorry.

Late Elementary/Early Middle - We were having an epic 'rock battle'. You and I weren't the only ones involved, but you were the only one hurt, and it was my fault. You didn't cry. You were SUCH a good sport. You and I walked together to the first-aid station, where an ambulance picked you up. I'm sorry.

Middle School - I punched you in the nose at a party. I was afraid of you and your friends, I ran and hid in the bathroom and cried. Worse, I am haunted by the feeling of my hand connecting with your face. I'm sorry.

Middle School - The boys and I gave you a hard time when you fell and hurt your face/mouth. I'm sorry.

Middle School - You stood up in front of all of us. You told us why you needed to leave. During my time in school, I don't remember a stronger show of bravery. Personally, I don't remember doing anything to you that needs forgiving, but I'm still sorry. We were kids, but we still should have known better.

High School - Open hand on the cheek. It was a dumb spat, I don't even remember what we were arguing about. You hit back! I threw your shoe! I'm almost certain someone else out there remembers this, too. They would love nothing more than to slap me with their shoe (which I have reason to believe is rather large!!!!) I'm so... so sorry, to both of you. (Also, please don't shoe-slap me)

To everyone who has told me their name, which I then promptly forgot. You MUST know I'm really bad with names. I want to work on it! Sorry!!!

To my roommates and neighbors - If I'm being too loud, or you're tired of hearing the same old thing over and over, tell me to shut up! I have headphones! I can be quiet!!!!! I'm sorry =)

To my family, friends, and loved ones out of state and out of country (Saludos y abrazos!!), I don't get to see you all half as much as I'd like. I'm sorry!! 

To EVERYONE who has helped me along the way, while expecting nothing in return. To EVERYONE who has loved and cared and supported for me over the years. To all my family and friends and doctors, this is my chance to give back. I'M SORRY it took so long to figure it out!!!

I'm sure I've left a lot off! I just can't think of any others off the top of my head right now.
As memories come to me, I will likely add to this list.

If I have done you wrong in the past, please, I beg your forgiveness.
If I offend you sometime in the future, please, I beg your forgiveness.


 
Go easy on me, baby!!!!
