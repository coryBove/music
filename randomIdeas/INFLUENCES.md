Here I list some of my favorite musicians and influences:

### music

Rock/Blues -

The Black Keys (AKRON, OHIO BABY!!!!)

Led Zeppelin (When someone asks my favorite band, it's hard not to say Zeppelin)

Pink Floyd (Who doesn't???)

Stevie Ray Vaughan (This guy is a legend. Look at In Session with Albert King, and his performance 
of Lenny at Carnegie. WOW)

Jimi Hendrix (Everyone knows who he is. Sleeping Pill OD, not alcohol. Check Wikipedia)

The White Stripes (Jack White also has many other noteworthy projects)

little hurricane (I've got a thing for female drummers in a 2 piece set, see above)

Sublime (Listened to their self-titled album SO many times. GREAT!)

Black Sabbath (I never paid much attention to Ozzy, but a friend put them on for New Years 2020, and I haven't looked back. I spent 3 months listening exclusively to their first 6-7 albumns. Iommi is unstoppable)

Red Hot Chili Peppers (Shout out to THE greatest record combo of all time, Stadium Arcadium)

Gary Clark Jr. - reminds me so much of Hendrix! Check out his version(s) of Catfish Blues

Greta Van Fleet - These guys came out of nowhere! If you haven't heard of them, and you'd like to hear what feels like a long-lost Zeppelin album(s!), look into them! Listen closely, though. They cleary have their own style and other influences.

Joe Bonamassa (I've had the pleasure of hearing him live in Youngstown. He puts on an AWESOME performance. This man is today's King of the Blues)

Joanne Shaw Taylor (Saw her at a small bar in Cleveland, had to leave early unfortunately. Incredible player and quite beautiful)

Samantha Fish (Let's have some fun!!!)

Ben Folds (Live/Five - Keep rocking those suburbs!!!)

Tedeschi Trucks Band - Husband/Wife duo. Keep living the dream!

I'd be remiss to forget others like:

The Beatles (Dad's favorite),

The Rolling Stones,

Tom Petty,

Robert Johnson,

Muddy Waters,

B.B. King,

Buddy Guy,

Eric Clapton,

ZZ Top,

and SOOOO many others that I'm not intentionally leaving out.

Hip-hop - (believe it or not!)

Atmosphere

Deltron 3030

G. Love & Special Sauce

36 Chambers (I won't pretend to know what the Wu Tang Clan went through to get off the ground. This album is NOT for the faint of heart, but it's seminal to almost all modern music today. On the last track of RHCP's Stadium Arcadium, during the interview, someone(drums or guitar) mentions they listened to this album on repeat when they weren't actively recording)


Electronic - 

Daft Punk (Tron Legacy soundtrack is EPIC. I LOVE 'Giorgio by Moroder' from Random Access Memories to get pumped up. If you're an amateur like myself, listen closely to the monologue and you'll know what I mean)

bassnectar (Music is, indeed, a drug)

Tycho

Bonobo

Com Truise

Country - 

Johnny Cash (I don't listen to Country a whole lot, but I'm sure many of you have heard his cover of Nine Inch Nails' 'Hurt'. This cover released as part of a 5?6? disc set before he passed, American Man, which are just stunning.)

Not otherwise classifiable -

Khruangbin - SUPER chillax, mostly instrumental

Too Many Zooz - INCREDIBLE horn section, a unique rythm section, and style unmatched by many.

### software

Paul Graham (of Hacker News fame, LISP hacker),

Robert C. Martin (Clean Code, etc. Uncle Bob),

Bruce Schneier,

Peter Norvig,

Ray Kurzweil,

Bill Gates,

Linus Torvalds,

Salman Khan,

Demis Hassabis,

A professor from college I won't mention by name. This man is a wizard on the keyboard, and has made substantial contributions to the C++ community. He worked directly under Bjarne, and I worked directly under him (as a student) for a very short stint. He's a hardass, but the best mentors always are (see Linus).

Any true master of the craft (and there are many not listed). When you see it in their writing, in their code, and in their work, it's impossible to ignore their passion. If I can hone my skills to be even 10% of what these people are capable of, I'd be ecstatic.

### family

First and foremost, my Father has had more influence on me than anyone in this endeavor, and he doesn't even know, because he is no longer with us.

Like many people today, he wasn't crazy about his job. Unfortunately, I don't know too much about what he did on site as a machinist. He would talk at length about issues he had at work, and how badly he wanted to retire.

My Dad's true passion lied in caring for and being there for his family.

Love you Dad, I want to make you proud!!!

My Mother. You've been with me through thick and thin. In and out of hospital stays (even during your endeavors through Law School!) and throughout my whole life you've shown me nothing but support.
I will be adding to this.

My sister, and her lovely growing family. I love you dearly, even though you're so far away.
I will be adding to this.

My extended relatives, on both sides of my family. I love you all so, so very much!
I will be adding to this.

My closest, expansive group of friends. You really mean the world to me.
I will be adding to this.

To all of the people who have had the patience to listen to me jam and practice. To everyone who I have had the pleasure of jamming with, and to everyone who has had the patience to to hear the same question I ask everyone: "Wanna jam!?"

### emergency responders / healthcare workers

Last, but certainly not least, I can't thank the first-responders from my past enough. Between Cleveland (Cleveland State University), Athens (Ohio University), Cuyahoga Falls, everyone in the Summit County area, North East Ohio, Ohio, USA, World, etc.

Of course there's no way I could possibly interact directly with all of these people, but if it weren't for them, I would not be here today.

This does not stop at the ER or hopsitals. This is for EVERY employee involved in healthcare in any way shape or form. From the nurses, doctors, all the way down to kitchen staff and janitorial services. Everyone involed in the distribution of medical supplies (You know who you are, Brother!), front desk services, dentists, therapists. EVERYONE!

Ya'll are truly [Angels](/ANGELS.md).

Best wishes,
