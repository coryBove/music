Here I list some of my favorite musicians and influences:

### music

Rock/Blues -

The Black Keys (AKRON, OHIO BABY!!!!)

Led Zeppelin (When someone asks my favorite band, it's hard not to say Zeppelin)

Pink Floyd (Who doesn't???)

Stevie Ray Vaughan (This guy is a legend. Look at In Session with Albert King, and his performance 
of Lenny at Carnegie. WOW)

Jimi Hendrix (Everyone knows who he is. Sleeping Pill OD, not alcohol. Check Wikipedia)

The White Stripes (Jack White also has many other noteworthy projects)

little hurricane (I've got a thing for female drummers in a 2 piece set, see above)

Sublime (Listened to their self-titled album SO many times. GREAT!)

Black Sabbath (I never paid much attention to Ozzy, but a friend put them on for New Years 2020, and I haven't looked back. I spent 3 months listening exclusively to their first 6-7 albumns. Iommi is unstoppable)

Red Hot Chili Peppers (Shout out to THE greatest record combo of all time, Stadium Arcadium)

Gary Clark Jr. - reminds me so much of Hendrix! Check out his version(s) of Catfish Blues

Greta Van Fleet - These guys came out of nowhere! If you haven't heard of them, and you'd like to hear what feels like a long-lost Zeppelin album(s!), look into them! Listen closely, though. They cleary have their own style and other influences.

Joe Bonamassa (I've had the pleasure of hearing him live in Youngstown. He puts on an AWESOME performance. This man is today's King of the Blues)

Joanne Shaw Taylor (Saw her at a small bar in Cleveland, had to leave early unfortunately. Incredible player and quite beautiful)

Samantha Fish (Let's have some fun!!!)

Ben Folds (Live/Five - Keep rocking those suburbs!!!)

I'd be remiss to forget others like:

The Beatles (Dad's favorite),

The Rolling Stones,

Tom Petty,

Robert Johnson,

Muddy Waters,

B.B. King,

Buddy Guy,

Eric Clapton,

ZZ Top,

and SOOOO many others that I'm not intentionally leaving out.

Hip-hop - (believe it or not!)

Atmosphere

Deltron 3030

G. Love & Special Sauce

36 Chambers (I won't pretend to know what the Wu Tang Clan went through to get off the ground. This album is NOT for the faint of heart, but it's seminal to almost all modern music today. On the last track of RHCP's Stadium Arcadium, during the interview, someone(drums or guitar) mentions they listened to this album on repeat when they weren't actively recording)


Electronic - 

Daft Punk (Tron Legacy soundtrack is EPIC. I LOVE 'Giorgio by Moroder' from Random Access Memories to get pumped up. If you're an amateur like myself, listen closely to the monologue and you'll know what I mean)

bassnectar (Music is, indeed, a drug)

Tycho

Bonobo

Com Truise

Country - 

Johnny Cash (I don't listen to Country a whole lot, but I'm sure many of you have heard his cover of Nine Inch Nails' 'Hurt'. This cover released as part of a 5?6? disc set before he passed, American Man, which are just stunning.)


### software

Paul Graham (of Hacker News fame, LISP hacker),

Robert C. Martin (Clean Code, etc. Uncle Bob),

Bruce Schneier,

Peter Norvig,

Ray Kurzweil,

Bill Gates,

Salman Khan,

Demis Hassabis,

A professor from college I won't mention by name. This man is a wizard on the keyboard, and has made substantial contributions to the C++ community. He worked directly under Bjarne, and I worked directly under him (as a student) for a very short stint. He's a hardass, but the best mentors always are.

Any true master of the craft (and there are many not listed). When you see it in their writing and in their code, it's impossible to ignore their passion. If I can hone my skills to be even 10% of what these people are capable of, I'd be ecstatic.
