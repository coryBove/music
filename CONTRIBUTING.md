If this project does end up raising any money, I plan to donate MOST of it to Mental Health research, awareness, and outreach.

If you want to support me directly, I will consider sponsorship from the right people. This project will likely need a lot of tender loving care. However, for the time-being, I'm already decently prepared financially, so do consider a different route first.

In leiu of cash donations, please consider doing your own outreach by sharing this project with loved ones.

Throughtout the next few months, I will do my best to stay open to PRs and suggestions, but this will mostly be a self-driven project.

PLEASE support your local Police/EMS/Fire/Hospitals any way you can. Everyone loves flowers and fruit baskets =). This would truly mean the world to me! These people put their lives on the line every day, and expect absolutely no reward.

In my personal opinion, there is no harder job than theirs.
