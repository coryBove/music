## I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. THIS PROJECT IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE OR OTHERWISE. IT IS AN INQUIRY INTO MY OWN PERSONAL MIND. IF YOU NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION, PLEASE SEEK A PROFESSIONAL!!!

### Hello! Welcome!

I'm going to be taking some time off work to pursue some hobbies, mainly music and art.

If you're really only interested in the music (WHICH IS TOTALLY COOL!!!!) then give the video below a quick watch, and/or check out my [Influences](randomIdeas/INFLUENCES.md)

I've been a professional software engineer since about 2016, and have been very fortunate to save up a small nest-egg in order to do this. This is a planned sabbatical, and I left my last job June 18th of 2020. 

See my [History](randomIdeas/HISTORY.md) for more about me.

See a growing list of [Songs](lyrics/README.md) here.

Please, see [Angels](ANGELS.md) for a tribute to first responders and healthcare workers.

Here's a short(4m) song I recorded recently (6/14/2020): (Also now on YouTube! https://youtu.be/vntyeARwM7Q!)
I need a lot of work on my vocals, but please bare with me, it gets slightly better towards the end.

Thanks so much for listening!
I know what you must be thinking: 'This amateur? A career in music?', but it's what I want to try to do, and I honestly believe if I put in the time and effort to improve, I may get somewhere.

You may be surprised to learn that the song is actually not a love sonnet. It's an idea that's been running through my mind for a long time. I was diagnosed with a severe mental illness back in 2011, and sometimes I have very strange thoughts. This, combined with some substance abuse, and you have a recipe for disaster.

Here's a story about what happened the week leading up to my (somewhat-planned) departure from work:

[Where did my marbles go?](MARBLES.md)

My short-term goal is to open-source, in this repo, my creative process. From writing lyrics, to posting recordings and practice sessions. All the way to open, transparent ramblings about what's on my mind and what helps me cope best with my mental illness (mostly music...).

My ultimate goal is to raise further awareness about Health in general, but Mental Health in particular.

I have personally never had a clearer sense of purpose and direction. I've been unwittingly preparing for this project for a long time, and now just recently, everything really started to come together. I have been looking for ways to give back to the folks who helped me through my tough times. This is it. Finally.

If you are interested in supporting this project at all, PLEASE share this link with your close friends/family. Whether it's via social media(meh), or direct message (preferred!!), don't be afraid to share!

Throughtout the next few months, I will do my best to stay open to PRs and suggestions, but this will mostly be a self-driven project.

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) / [Collaboration](COLLABORATION.md) for more on this.
