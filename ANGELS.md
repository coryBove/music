To the Police Officers who arrived first,

To the EMS crew who arrived shortly after,

To the ER staff where EMS dropped me off,

And to the 'Unit for Observation' staff who helped me recover,

Including but not limted to the Chaplain, all the Doctors and Nurses -

That was a long couple of days!!!

I cannot thank ya'll enough for your love, encouragement, and support.

I have a disease of the mind. You have put my mind at ease. At no point was I close to death, yet I still feel as if I'd been saved by guardian angels.

The mind is powerful.

It can generate intense happiness, fear, hope, sadness, confusion, hatred, and love.
Unfortunately, we do not always have full control over our minds or how it responds to certain stimuli.

If we could work on our minds, and massage them to respond more positively,
we may be able to overcome some of our present issues.

If we can choose to laugh, when instead we should cry.

Choose to love, when instead we could hate....

Choose to throw flowers instead of rocks.

Health workers and emergency responders are our guardian angels here on Earth. There is no job harder than yours.

In the future, my wish is that you will be met with optimism and hope instead of fear and anger.

Most wish to run when they see the police coming for them, but I know you are here to help.

If this strikes a chord with you, please share it with family and loved ones. Reach out for their love and support directly, you will be AMAZED by the response. We love and respect you, and we want to hear from you.

You really are the best!!!!
