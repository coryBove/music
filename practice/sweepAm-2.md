This is version 2 of the same pentatonic sweeping exercise. Now with more chords in the loop! (Am, Dm, Em, Am)

Note: I did spend time doing un-recorded practice before this.

When I mess up, I try to noodle until the loop goes back to the top (as I did before). I realized if I'm going to get the transition down, I need to noodle on the lower end and be ready to go back to the top. I'm starting to think a lot further ahead about what I'm playing.

Every time I record a new version, I hit the pattern more often and recover more successfully when I mess up.

At this point I'm MUCH more comfortable than I was only a few days ago with the 5 pentatonic shapes in A Minor.

When I started this drill last week, I couldn't play the pattern even 1 time through in any shape. Progress!
