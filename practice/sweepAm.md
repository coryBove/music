Working on a pentatonic sweep picking exercise in the key of A Minor in as many positions as I can.

You can hear me trying to feel out the shapes.

I 'get' the loop around 2:30, it's clearly not perfect, but nothing is perfect!

This is my first attempt at a transparent practice session.

(16m - audio only)

The only position I'm really comfortable with is '1'. There are 5 total positions that repeat themselves after the 12th fret. I know all 5, but they need work.

I need to work on going back to the top of the scale and repeating the pattern multiple times in succession.
