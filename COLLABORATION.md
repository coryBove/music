I will be looking into sound visualization and recording resources. Ideally these tools will be free and open source.

I'd love to get some live sound visualization going for some of my recording sessions. If you have any experience in this area, or know anyone who does, please reach out.

As far as recording, I plan to take a deep dive into Audacity. It is a higly customizable and powerful recording tool which is free and open source. You can find their repo on GitHub.
