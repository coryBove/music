If this project does end up raising any money, I plan to donate MOST of it to Mental Health research, awareness, and outreach.

If you want to support me directly, I will consider sponsorship from the right people. This project will likely need a lot of tender loving care. However, for the time-being, I'm already decently prepared financially, so do consider a different route first.

In leiu of cash donations, please consider doing your own outreach by sharing this project with loved ones.
