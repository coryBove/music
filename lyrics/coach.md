Black Tiger Sharks
and Butterflies in the pool

Why is this so hard?

Running turtle pace up hills
around the school

Why is this so hard?

Tennis balls, off the walls
But I stil lose

Why is this so hard?

~Chorus
Please be hard on me
Don't go too easy
But but gentle

Staying late after class
The time is moving too fast
Still can't solve the problem

Find the max and the min,
with only one thing in,

Why is this so hard?

~Chorus

A gentle kiss on the lips
by your swift axe kick
Don't go easy!
